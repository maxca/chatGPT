Programing language
- Programming languages are languages that are used to create software applications and computer programs.
- There are many programming languages, each with their own syntax, features, and uses.
- Popular programming languages include Java, Python, JavaScript, C++, and PHP.
- Different programming languages are better suited for different tasks and purposes. For example, Java is commonly used for enterprise applications, Python for data science and machine learning, and JavaScript for web development.
- Some programming languages are interpreted, meaning that they are executed directly by the computer, while others are compiled, meaning that they are translated into machine code before execution.
- Learning a programming language requires practice, patience, and a strong understanding of programming concepts like variables, functions, and control structures.
- Choosing the right programming language depends on factors like the project's requirements, team's expertise, and development goals.

Apis
- APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) are sets of protocols, routines, and tools that allow software applications to communicate and exchange data with each other.
- APIs provide a standardized way for different applications to interact with each other, regardless of their underlying technology or architecture.
- APIs can be used to retrieve data from a remote source, perform specific operations, or integrate different applications.
- APIs can be divided into two categories: RESTful and non-RESTful. RESTful APIs use the HTTP protocol and standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to perform operations, while non-RESTful APIs use their own custom protocols and methods.
- Popular APIs include social media APIs like Facebook and Twitter, payment APIs like PayPal and Stripe, and weather APIs like OpenWeatherMap.
- APIs can significantly improve the functionality and user experience of applications, but can also introduce additional complexity and security risks.
- Choosing the right API depends on factors like the project's requirements, data sources, and available resources.

Git version control
- Git is a version control system that allows developers to track changes to their code and collaborate on software projects.
- Git allows for flexibility and independence, as developers can work on their own local copies of code and push changes to a central repository.
- Git can track changes over time and allows for code reviews and collaboration.
- Git is widely used for open-source projects and has become an essential tool for DevOps.

Agile methodology 
- Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
- Working software over comprehensive documentation
- Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
- Responding to change over following a plan

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- reuseable programming
- modular programming
- maintaining


Test-Driven Development (TDD)
- write a test that fails.
- write code to make the test pass.
- refactor the code to improve its design and maintainability.

Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD)
- CI/CD stands for Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery or Continuous Deployment.
- CI/CD is a DevOps practice that involves automating the building, testing, and deployment of software applications.
- Continuous Integration involves automatically building and testing code changes as soon as they are committed to the repository.
- Continuous Delivery/Deployment involves automatically deploying code changes to production after they have been tested and verified.
- CI/CD helps increase the speed and quality of software delivery, and allows for faster feedback and iteration cycles.

DevOps
- DevOps is a software development approach that emphasizes collaboration and communication between developers and IT operations teams.
- DevOps aims to streamline the software development process by breaking down silos between teams, automating processes, and promoting a culture of continuous improvement.
- DevOps involves using tools and practices like agile development, continuous integration and delivery, and infrastructure as code to achieve faster and more reliable software delivery.
The ultimate goal of DevOps is to deliver high-quality software faster, with improved efficiency, and at lower costs.

Microservices
- Microservices is an architectural approach to software development that involves breaking down large applications into smaller, independent services.
Each microservice is designed to perform a specific function and can be developed and deployed independently.
- Microservices communicate with each other through APIs, allowing for greater flexibility and scalability.
- Microservices allow for faster and more frequent deployments, as changes can be made to individual services without affecting the entire application.
- Microservices also allow for greater resiliency and fault tolerance, as a failure in one service does not necessarily affect the entire application.
- Microservices can be more complex to develop and manage, but can provide significant benefits in terms of scalability, flexibility, and speed of development.

Kubernetes orchestration

- Kubernetes is an open-source container orchestration platform that automates the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.
- Kubernetes provides a unified API for managing containers, allowing for easy deployment and management of applications across multiple hosts.
- Kubernetes uses a declarative configuration model, allowing developers to specify desired states for their applications and leaving Kubernetes to manage the underlying infrastructure.
- Kubernetes provides a wide range of features, including automatic scaling, rolling updates, self-healing, and service discovery.
- Kubernetes can be run on-premises or in the cloud, and supports a wide range of container runtimes and platforms.
- Kubernetes is widely used in production environments, particularly for large-scale, cloud-native applications.
- Kubernetes provides a powerful toolset for managing containerized applications, but can be complex to learn and manage.


Web development frameworks (e.g., React, Angular, Vue.js)
- Web development frameworks are software libraries that provide pre-written code and tools to facilitate the development of web applications.
- Frameworks can provide a wide range of functionality, from basic templates and routing to more advanced features like database integration and security.
- Frameworks can be divided into two categories: server-side frameworks, which run on the server and generate HTML to be sent to the client, and client-side frameworks, which run on the client's browser and provide dynamic user interfaces and interactions.
Popular server-side frameworks include Ruby on Rails, Django, and Express.js, while popular client-side frameworks include React, Angular, and Vue.js.
- Frameworks can significantly reduce development time and improve code quality, but can also introduce additional complexity and dependencies.
Choosing the right framework depends on factors like the project's requirements, team's expertise, and development goals.

Database management systems 
- Database management systems (DBMS) are software applications that allow users to create, store, and manage data in a structured way.
- DBMS can handle large amounts of data, allowing for efficient and reliable storage and retrieval of information.
- DBMS can be divided into two categories: relational and non-relational. Relational DBMS use a tabular format to store data, while non-relational DBMS use a variety of formats, such as document, key-value, and graph.
- Popular relational DBMS include MySQL, PostgreSQL, and Oracle, while popular non-relational DBMS include MongoDB, Redis, and Cassandra.
- DBMS provide a wide range of features, including data integrity, security, backup and recovery, and querying.
Choosing the right DBMS depends on factors like the type and amount of data being stored, performance requirements, and budget.
